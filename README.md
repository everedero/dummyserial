# Python Module for Dummy Serial

Emulates pyserial's write/read responses from a serial port.

## Install

    pip3 install dummyserial

## Usage

Instead of:

    from serial import Serial

Use:

    from dummyserial import Serial

It is possible to use the MonkeyPatch package:
```
from pytest import MonkeyPatch
import dummyserial
import lookup_mock
monkeypatch.setattr("dummyserial.lookup.default", lookup_mock.default)
monkeypatch = MonkeyPatch()
monkeypatch.setattr("serial.Serial", dummyserial.Serial)
```
Then you can call your application main function, and every call to the serial.Serial object
will be replaced by a dummyserial.Serial call as if you had a monkey in a production line
exchanging one object for another. This allows you to execute tests without modifying anything in the
application code.

Donâ€™t forget that this will only work if you monkeypatch before you
call any other module from your application.

### Implement look-up functions
This version uses a look-up function instead of a table.

A lookup function has to take as input a string representing the UART command,
and a default invalid parameter.
It has to return either a string or a bytes string.

Exemple of lookup, always returning byte 0:
```
def exemple(in_str, ans_when_invalid):
    out_str = b"\x00"
    return(out_str)
```

In order to use the new lookup, you can either open the serial port with the optional "lookup" argument:

    ser = dummyserial.Serial("dev/ttyUSB0", lookup=myfunc)

Or you can override it with MonkeyPatch, in order to have your lookup function live in the same test directory
as the project you need UART mocking for.

```
from pytest import MonkeyPatch
monkeypatch = MonkeyPatch()
import custom_lookup
monkeypatch.setattr("dummyserial.lookup.default", custom_lookup.default)
import dummyserial
monkeypatch.setattr("serial.Serial", dummyserial.Serial)
```

The order matters and the lookup override has to take place before the dummy module import.
